# Copilot-Client-Intake-POC
# Microsoft Copilot ‚Äì AI-Powered Client Intake Automation (POC)

A Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrating how to integrate **Microsoft Power Platform** (Forms, Power Automate, SharePoint, Outlook) with **Copilot Studio** to build an AI-driven client intake and triage system.  

This project showcases **low-code AI orchestration** and **agentic workflow automation** in the Microsoft ecosystem.

## üöÄ Overview
Financial advisory and service teams often receive dozens of client queries daily, ranging from routine questions to urgent requests.  
Manually sorting, prioritizing, and responding to these requests is time-consuming and error-prone.  

This POC automates the process:
1. **Client submits a form** (via Microsoft Forms).  
2. **Power Automate flow triggers** ‚Üí captures form data.  
3. **Rule-based urgency classification** (keywords like *urgent*, *emergency*) is applied.  
4. **SharePoint list** stores all client requests with urgency status.  
5. **Automated email notifications** are sent to confirm intake.  
6. **Copilot Studio chatbot** enables natural language queries over the stored requests.
